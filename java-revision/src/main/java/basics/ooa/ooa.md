Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach
•	Declare and instantiate Java objects including nested class objects, and explain the object life-cycle including creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection
•	Create classes and records, and define and use instance and static fields and methods, constructors, and instance and static initializers
•	Implement overloading, including var-arg methods
•	Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, and make objects immutable
•	Implement inheritance, including abstract and sealed classes. Override methods, including that of Object class. Implement polymorphism and differentiate object type versus reference type. Perform type casting, identify object types using instanceof operator and pattern matching
•	Create and use interfaces, identify functional interfaces, and utilize private, static, and default interface methods
•	Create and use enumerations with fields, methods and constructors
